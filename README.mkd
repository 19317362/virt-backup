virt-backup [WORK IN PROGRESS]
==============================

Backup your kvm guests (using the blockcommit feature) managed by libvirt. The
main goal is to do a modest alternative to the Proxmox VE backup system
(without their vma system), to automatically backup your disks (with optional
compression) and easily restore one.
